  <h1>Smart Joint <span style="font-size: 15px;"> for dexterous gripping and manipulation</span></h1>
    <br>
      <p>
        Based on previous studies and my experience in robotic mechanical design, I observed the lack of an effective method for balancing force, torque, and controllability in serial multi-joint mechanisms (such as robotic fingers and continuum robots). To address this challenge and enhance dexterity while maintaining sufficient force within the mechanism, I proposed the Smart Joint idea.

        <strong>Smart join idea from design to prototype</strong>

        I. Smart joint detailed design
        <br><br>
        II. A cross-sectional rendering is provided to demonstrate the inner configuration of the mechanism.
        <br><br>
        III. A functional prototype was developed and tested to evaluate the concept.

    <p>
     In conventional approaches, if the torque-generating actuator is placed directly inside each joint (e.g., in finger joints), the mechanism must be relatively large, and due to limited space, the actuator typically produces insufficient torque. On the other hand, if the torque source is located remotely (e.g., in the palm or forearm instead of inside the finger), then precise control of a serial multi-joint mechanism either requires a large number of tendons or linkages or forces a compromise in controllability by reducing the degrees of independent motion.
     The Smart Joint method offers a novel alternative. In this approach, a single actuator per rotational plane is used to drive the farthest link in a serial robotic mechanism (like a finger) via a tendon-driven system capable of flexion and extension. The key idea is that if we can actively control the rotational stiffness of each joint, we can determine which joint moves and when.
     By increasing the stiffness of all joints and selectively reducing it in the target joint, only that joint will move in response to the tendon actuation. After completing the movement, the stiffness distribution can be reconfigured to target the next joint. Coordinated motion of multiple joints is also possible if desired.
     The Smart Joint approach provides a highly efficient, low-energy, compact, cost-effective, and commercially viable solution with fast response times and considerable joint stiffness.

        <strong>Key Strengths:</strong> The modular parallel robotic design allows the system to continue operating even if one module fails; the faulty module can be isolated while the remaining modules take over its tasks seamlessly, All components of the system, from reloadable feeders handling bulk products to machine vision units, are designed to be highly durable, enabling continuous operation in 150-hour shifts, Multiple types of task-specific robots were developed with innovative and cost-effective design approaches, ensuring both versatility and efficiency.

    Mechanically, the Smart Joint is implemented by integrating a rotational locking mechanism into the joint. This mechanism consists of two coaxial cylinders‚Äîone inside the other‚Äîwith defined surface roughness. A working fluid is placed between these surfaces. At room temperature (the system's operating temperature), the working fluid exists as solid crystals that, when melted and cured in contact with the rough surfaces, form a strong intermolecular bond that greatly increases the joint's rotational stiffness, effectively locking it.
    When the controller decides to unlock the joint, thermal energy is applied to the working fluid, triggering a phase change to liquid. This weakens the bond between the cylinders, allowing the joint to rotate. The external tendon drive mechanism can then actuate the joint. Once movement is complete, the system removes the thermal energy, causing the fluid to re-solidify and restore stiffness.
    My master's thesis introduced this concept and implemented it in a prototype joint.

      <div class="citation">
        <strong>Key Strengths:</strong> The extremely compact size of the machine allows for multiple units to operate simultaneously. If the carton, product, or even the leaflet changes, the system can quickly resume cartoning for the new item by replacing a module.<br>

  </div>

  <p>
    The design and development of the cartoning machine were driven by a modular, adjustment-free concept. In this system, when the carton, product, or leaflet changes, the machine can be reconfigured to handle the new item simply by replacing one or more modules, without requiring any manual adjustments.
    To minimize the overall footprint of the machine, a mechanism called the Carton Bender was invented. This system actively performs the entire carton-closing process in a single step when the carton is positioned in front of it. Unlike conventional systems that rely on multiple stations for sequential operations, this approach eliminates the need for the carton to move between stations, resulting in a significantly more compact machine.

      <div class="citation">
        <strong>Key Strengths:</strong> This machine is capable of labeling parts of various custom sizes. Thanks to its fully automated labeling unit, it can operate at very high speeds without issues such as label tearing, The customized feeder is designed to handle a wide range of product types and dimensions, ensuring versatility across different applications.<br>

  <p>
   This labeling machine was originally designed and built to complement the insulin pen assembly line. Given the high throughput of the pen assembly system, the labeling unit needed to match its capacity and reliably label all products coming from the upstream process.
   The high labeling speed required the development of fully active labeling mechanisms, which were optimized to control label tension precisely and prevent tearing at high speeds.
   Eventually, the machine was redesigned and adapted for other products as well. One of its key advantages is its customized feeding system, which significantly reduces the operator‚Äôs workload and improves overall efficiency.

    Perhaps the most important reason I include this project in my industrial portfolio is the unique and rewarding experience of designing and manufacturing a high-volume, cost-effective device with advanced mechanical capabilities.
    Extensive exploration of various production methods and materials eventually led us to the final product, a solution that balances affordability with technical performance.
