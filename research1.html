  <h1>Smart Joint</h1><p>for dexterous gripping andmanipulation</p>
    <br>
      <p>
      After the onset of COVID and the mandatory university lockdown, I was invited by a friend to gain experience working in industry. A part-time position at <a href="https://pooyeshdarou.com/">"Pooyesh Darou"</a>, a pharmaceutical company, gave me the opportunity to work on designing robots for automating high-throughput production systems. This experience allowed me to significantly improve my designs in terms of reliability and long-term operational performance.
      Even after the university and academic environment reopened, I continued the projects I had started on a part-time basis to further develop and enhance them. The work progressed to the point where the pharmaceutical company, impressed by the promising results, decided to establish a separate company called <a href="https://pooyeshmachine.ir/">"Pooyesh Machine",</a> aimed specifically at developing and manufacturing robotic pharmaceutical production systems.

  <p>
    Based on my academic experience in the mechanical design and fabrication of robotic arms for pharmaceutical product handling, I initiated the design and development of a SCARA robotic arm. Inspired by the "KUKA" SCARA robot and designed to match similar workspace dimensions, payload capacity, degrees of freedom, and axis speed, while also considering the constraints of pharmaceutical environments, I developed and manufactured a customized robotic arm.
    Through the use of efficient force transmission mechanisms and strategic placement of the motors at the arm base, combined with topology optimization in structural design, a well-balanced mass distribution was achieved to reduce the arm‚Äôs rotational inertia. One of the key achievements of this project was the use of stepper motors with appropriate torque, along with the design and fabrication of a mechanical structure for absolute encoders based on <a href="https://ams-osram.com/products/sensor-solutions/position-sensors">" AMS Osram",</a> encoder ICs, ensuring their precise installation.
    Equipped with a suitable gripper at the end effector, the robot is capable of performing a wide range of tasks in pharmaceutical packaging and handling workflows.

      <a href="#">High-Capacity, Vision-Based, Robotic Assembly System with Parallel Modules for Insulin Injection Pens</a>
      <div class="citation">
        <strong>Key Strengths:</strong> The modular parallel robotic design allows the system to continue operating even if one module fails; the faulty module can be isolated while the remaining modules take over its tasks seamlessly, All components of the system, from reloadable feeders handling bulk products to machine vision units, are designed to be highly durable, enabling continuous operation in 150-hour shifts, Multiple types of task-specific robots were developed with innovative and cost-effective design approaches, ensuring both versatility and efficiency.<br>

  </div>

  <p>

The largest and most detailed mechanical design I have completed in industry was for an insulin pen assembly machine. Due to the unique design of the pens, there were no existing machines on the market capable of assembling them at a mass-production scale. Moreover, the assembly process required the integration of a vision system during one of its most critical stages.
These disposable insulin injection pens consist of four components. Aside from the drug cartridges, the remaining parts are delivered in bulk and unsorted at the beginning of the assembly line. The high production rate (7,000 assembled pens per hour) demanded innovative solutions for every part of the system, particularly in the design of feeders and transfer mechanisms.
The system was built using independent modules operating in parallel. If one module fails, the rest of the system can continue functioning, and the faulty module can be replaced with minimal downtime. Significant effort was also dedicated to optimizing motion sequences to maximize the speed and accuracy of the vision-based alignment process.
This project provided me with invaluable experience in designing for durability and reliability, especially under the demanding conditions of continuous six-day operational shifts.

        <h2>Cartoning Machine</h2>

  <div class="research-block">
    <img src="images/industry/Cartoning_th.png" alt="Cartoning">
    <div class="research-text">
      <a href="#">A small-sized, modular, and non-continuous operation cartoning machine</a>
      <div class="citation">
        <strong>Key Strengths:</strong> The extremely compact size of the machine allows for multiple units to operate simultaneously. If the carton, product, or even the leaflet changes, the system can quickly resume cartoning for the new item by replacing a module.<br>
      </div>
      <div class="links">
        <a href="#">Catalogue</a> | <a href="#">Video</a>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    The design and development of the cartoning machine were driven by a modular, adjustment-free concept. In this system, when the carton, product, or leaflet changes, the machine can be reconfigured to handle the new item simply by replacing one or more modules, without requiring any manual adjustments.
    To minimize the overall footprint of the machine, a mechanism called the Carton Bender was invented. This system actively performs the entire carton-closing process in a single step when the carton is positioned in front of it. Unlike conventional systems that rely on multiple stations for sequential operations, this approach eliminates the need for the carton to move between stations, resulting in a significantly more compact machine.

        <h2>Labeling Machine</h2>

  <div class="research-block">
    <img src="images/industry/Labeling_th.png" alt="Labeling">
    <div class="research-text">
      <a href="#">A customized, high-speed, fully automated labeling machine with an integrated feeder</a>
      <div class="citation">
        <strong>Key Strengths:</strong> This machine is capable of labeling parts of various custom sizes. Thanks to its fully automated labeling unit, it can operate at very high speeds without issues such as label tearing, The customized feeder is designed to handle a wide range of product types and dimensions, ensuring versatility across different applications.<br>
      </div>
      <div class="links">
        <a href="#">Catalogue</a> | <a href="#">Video</a>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
   This labeling machine was originally designed and built to complement the insulin pen assembly line. Given the high throughput of the pen assembly system, the labeling unit needed to match its capacity and reliably label all products coming from the upstream process.
   The high labeling speed required the development of fully active labeling mechanisms, which were optimized to control label tension precisely and prevent tearing at high speeds.
   Eventually, the machine was redesigned and adapted for other products as well. One of its key advantages is its customized feeding system, which significantly reduces the operator‚Äôs workload and improves overall efficiency.

  <p>
    Perhaps the most important reason I include this project in my industrial portfolio is the unique and rewarding experience of designing and manufacturing a high-volume, cost-effective device with advanced mechanical capabilities.
    Extensive exploration of various production methods and materials eventually led us to the final product, a solution that balances affordability with technical performance.

    Despite decades of research and development, myoelectric prosthetic hands lack functionality and are often rejected by users. This lack in functionality can be partially attributed to the widely accepted anthropomorphic design ideology in the field; attempting to replicate human hand form and function despite severe limitations in control and sensing technology. 
    Instead, prosthetic hands can be tailored to perform specific tasks without increasing complexity by shedding the constraints of anthropomorphism. In this paper, we develop and evaluate four open-source modular non-humanoid devices to perform the motion required to replicate human flicking motion and to twist a screwdriver, and the functionality required to pick and place flat objects and to cut paper. Experimental results from these devices demonstrate that, versus a humanoid prosthesis, non-humanoid prosthesis design dramatically improves task performance, reduces user compensatory movement, and reduces task load. Case studies with two end users demonstrate the translational benefits of this research. We found that special attention should be paid to monitoring end-user task load to ensure positive rehabilitation outcomes.

    Human hands are able to grasp a wide range of object sizes, shapes, and weights, achieved via reshaping and altering their apparent grasping stiffness between compliant power and rigid precision. Achieving similar versatility in robotic hands remains a challenge, which has often been addressed by adding extra controllable degrees of freedom, tactile sensors, or specialised extra grasping hardware, at the cost of control complexity and robustness. We introduce a novel reconfigurable four-fingered two-actuator underactuated gripper ‚Äì the Hydra Hand ‚Äì that switches between compliant power and rigid precision grasps using a single motor, while generating those grasps via a single hydromechanical actuator ‚Äì exhibiting adaptive simplicity and high versatility.
