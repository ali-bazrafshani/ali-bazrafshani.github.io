  <h1>Industry-</h1>
    <br>
      <p>
      After the onset of COVID and the mandatory university lockdown, I was invited by a friend to gain experience working in industry. A part-time position at <a href="https://pooyeshdarou.com/">"Pooyesh Darou"</a>, a pharmaceutical company, gave me the opportunity to work on designing robots for automating high-throughput production systems. This experience allowed me to significantly improve my designs in terms of reliability and long-term operational performance.
      Even after the university and academic environment reopened, I continued the projects I had started on a part-time basis to further develop and enhance them. The work progressed to the point where the pharmaceutical company, impressed by the promising results, decided to establish a separate company called <a href="https://pooyeshmachine.ir/">"Pooyesh Machine",</a> aimed specifically at developing and manufacturing robotic pharmaceutical production systems.

    ...Despite decades of research and development, myoelectric prosthetic hands lack functionality and are often rejected by users. This lack in functionality can be partially attributed to the widely accepted anthropomorphic design ideology in the field; attempting to replicate human hand form and function despite severe limitations in control and sensing technology. 
    Instead, prosthetic hands can be tailored to perform specific tasks without increasing complexity by shedding the constraints of anthropomorphism. In this paper, we develop and evaluate four open-source modular non-humanoid devices to perform the motion required to replicate human flicking motion and to twist a screwdriver, and the functionality required to pick and place flat objects and to cut paper. Experimental results from these devices demonstrate that, versus a humanoid prosthesis, non-humanoid prosthesis design dramatically improves task performance, reduces user compensatory movement, and reduces task load. Case studies with two end users demonstrate the translational benefits of this research. We found that special attention should be paid to monitoring end-user task load to ensure positive rehabilitation outcomes.
